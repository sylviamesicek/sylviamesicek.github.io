Hello! I am an undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Utah. I am pursuing a career in computational astrophysics and have a particular fascination for gravitation and black hole physics.

## Research

<span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></span> **Numerical Relativity:** I study theoretical black hole physics in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, working in Dr. John Belz's numerical relativity group. I use numerical methods to explore "critical phenomena" occuring on the threshold of black hole formation. 
My work includes:
- Developing an advanced codebase for adaptively solving PDEs in axisymmetry.
- Adapting the Einstein Field Equations into forms suitable for numerical integration.
- Analyzing simulations of black hole collapse.

<span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-code"></i></span> **Formal Verification:**
In my first two years at the University of Utah, I worked in the School of Computing in Dr. Anton Burtsev's systems programming [research group](https://mars-research.github.io/). I focused on using SMT theorem provers to mathematically verify low-level microkernel code.
